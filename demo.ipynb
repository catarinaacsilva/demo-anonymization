    "## Anonymization process\n",
    "\n",
    "K-anonymity is a privacy-preserving technique designed to protect individuals' identities within a dataset. It works by ensuring that each record in the dataset cannot be uniquely identified when compared to at least k-1 other records. In simpler terms, it involves grouping individuals together so that they cannot be singled out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve k-anonymity, data is often generalized or suppressed. This means that specific details, such as exact dates of birth or precise addresses, are replaced with broader categories (e.g., age range, city). This reduces the granularity of the data, making it more difficult to link a specific record to an individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is k-anonymity important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, privacy concerns are paramount. K-anonymity helps mitigate the risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access. By obscuring individual identities, it prevents malicious actors from re-identifying individuals and exploiting their sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of k-anonymity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While k-anonymity is a valuable tool, it has limitations. One significant drawback is the potential for privacy breaches through background knowledge attacks. If an attacker possesses additional information about an individual, they may be able to narrow down the group of records and identify the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, k-anonymity remains a fundamental technique in data privacy and is often used in conjunction with other privacy-preserving methods to provide robust protection for sensitive data."
